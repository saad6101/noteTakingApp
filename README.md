Core Features
🔐 Security as a Craft

Mandatory Login: Unlock with password, PIN, or biometrics. No entry without your keys.

Auth + Secret Keys: Notes are encrypted with AES-256. Only your secret keys can decrypt them.

Zero-Knowledge Design: No data leaves your device—ever. Not even we can access it.

🗒️ Pure Note-Taking

✍️ Text Notes: Write freely in plain text. No formatting, no distractions.

🎙️ Voice Notes: Record audio directly to your device. No cloud processing, no AI—just raw, private sound.

📂 Manual Organization: Create folders and name files yourself. No tags, no search, no automation.

💻 Local-First. Cloud-Never.

100% Offline: Everything stays on your device. No sync, no servers, no internet required.

Encrypted Storage: Data is locked before saving. Even physical breaches stay futile.

Why NoteTaking: The Art?
Privacy Without Pretense: No feature bloat, no data trails. Just notes and encryption.

For Discreet Creators: Journalers, thinkers, and anyone who values silence over algorithms.

Battery-Friendly: Lightweight and efficient, even for long recordings.

The Art of Owning Your Thoughts
This isn’t just an app—it’s a manifesto. A rejection of surveillance, cloud dependency, and digital noise. Here, your words and voice remain offline, encrypted, and eternally yours. No stage, no audience. Just you and your craft.

“Privacy is the canvas; your thoughts are the art.”
